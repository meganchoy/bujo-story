Dave began searching throughout the app store for something to help him. He hired therapists. He 
asked friends for help. Dave was desparate. As the days progressed, dave became more an more irritable.
He started yelling at those close to him, ruining his prized relationships. All because he couldn't 
organize his life. 

Ayaz:
Dave sat there, alone and sad, waiting for something to turn his life around. He looked at canvas again
only to see that his grades just dropped into the D range. He knew in that moment that there needed to 
be a change. A change from within. From that moment on, Dave vowed to be more organized and work harder.
"But how?" Dave wondered.

Lucas:
Dave was so desperate and out of options that he was trying anything to fix his life. One day he came
across a buzzfeed article titled "9 easy ways to fix your entire life." 'Perfect!' thought Dave. He read
9 easy ways and started implementing them immediately. As if by magic, Dave's grades had risen to a 4.0
within 20 minutes of reading the article. Who knew it was as easy as things like: "#7: Eat Breakfast
Everyday."
